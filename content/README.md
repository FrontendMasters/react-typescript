## Appendix: Bonus Content

There are some things that we probably won't get to in this workshop, but I'm including them as an expansion pack for you to explore.

### TypeScript

* [Types versus interfaces](Types%20versus%20interfaces.md)
* [Function overloads](Function%20overloads.md)

### Common component patterns

* [Higher-order components](Higher-order%20components.md)
* [Render props](Render%20props.md)
* [Custom hooks](Custom%20hooks.md)

## More advanced component patterns
