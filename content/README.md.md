## Fundamentals

* The very basics
  * [Using TypeScript without even trying](Using%20TypeScript%20without%20even%20trying.md)
  * [Migrating from PropTypes](Migrating%20from%20PropTypes.md)
  * [Refactoring from PropTypes, an exercise](Refactoring%20from%20PropTypes,%20an%20exercise.md)
  * [Refactoring from PropTypes, a solution](Refactoring%20from%20PropTypes,%20a%20solution.md)
  * [Commonly-used props](Commonly-used%20props.md)
* Component children
  * [Typing children, an exercise](Typing%20children,%20an%20exercise.md)
  * [Typing children, a solution](Typing%20children,%20a%20solution.md)
  * [Built-in helpers for typing children in React](Built-in%20helpers%20for%20typing%20children%20in%20React.md)

## Typing Hooks

* Type the `useState` hook
  * [Adding state to Accident Counter](Adding%20state%20to%20Accident%20Counter.md)
  * [useState, an exercise](useState,%20an%20exercise.md)
  * [useState, a solution](useState,%20a%20solution.md)
* [Setting state without a default value](Setting%20state%20without%20a%20default%20value.md)
* [State and events, an exercise](State%20and%20events,%20an%20exercise.md)
* [State and events, a solution](State%20and%20events,%20a%20solution.md)
* Now with Filtering
* [With Filtering, a solution](With%20Filtering,%20a%20solution.md)

## Working with Reducers

* [Typing reducers](Typing%20reducers.md)
* [Passing `dispatch` as a prop](Passing%20%60dispatch%60%20as%20a%20prop.md)
* [Typing actions and reducers, an exercise](Typing%20actions%20and%20reducers,%20an%20exercise.md)
* [Typing actions and reducers, a solution](Typing%20actions%20and%20reducers,%20a%20solution.md)

## The Context API

* [The Context API](The%20Context%20API.md)
* [Using state management and the Context API](Using%20state%20management%20and%20the%20Context%20API.md)

## Just Enough TypeScript

* [Generics](Generics.md)
* [Utility types](Utility%20types.md), a tour
* [Type template literals](Type%20template%20literals.md)

## The Context API, Revisited

* [Custom Context hooks](Custom%20Context%20hooks.md)
* [createContext](createContext.md)

## Advanced component patterns
