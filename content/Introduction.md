## Who is this for?

This workshop is for anyone who is interested in learning how to use TypeScript with React. While there is **no expectation** that you're familiar with TypeScript, we're not going to be covering the basics of TypeScript directly. Instead, we'll be learning it within the context of building simple components in React. If you're familiar with building React applications using TypeScript already, some of the content that we're going to cover is going to be things you already know. That said, I have a suspicion that you'll pick up a few tips and tricks along the way. I also hope that it will reinforce the fundamentals for you.

## Why should I take this course?

* Type checking at compile time is way better than things crashing or—worse—behaving unexpectedly at run time.
* You get a better development experience because autocomplete knows more about what you’re intending on doing.
* Large codebases stay more maintainable because you’re able to put guardrails on how your code can be used.

## What's about to go down?

We're going to spend a little bit starting with the *very basics* of using TypeScript and React together. But, by the end things are going to escalate to implementing some very advanced patterns that typically leave our friends who didn't make the investment getting the fundamentals to want to throw in the towel.

* Things are going to start fairly simply for those of us who have used React before. We'll be passing props into components and setting some state.
* By the end of our time together we'll be dynamically typing polymorphic components, adding type safety—and more importatly, autocomplete—to higher components, and creating type guards that prevent our components from ending up in unexpected states.

## Getting set up

You don't need a lot to get rocking and/or rolling with this course. In fact, most of the examples and exercises have versions that are hosted on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/). So, you probably only need a web browser and if you're reading this, you likely already have one of those.

But, let's assume that you also want to work on some of this stuff locally as well. In that case, you're going to want to have the following installed:

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/). This course was tested using the latest LTS release of Node at the time (e.g. 18.12.1), but it honestly shouldn't matter much.
* You're going to need an editor of some kind. I **highly recommend** using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). But, you likely already have opinions on this topic—but that's going to be what I'm using.

## My set up

In case you're morbidly curious about what I'm using as we spend the next several hours together, here is a quick rundown of my setup.

* **Font**: [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode). It's basically a version of Mozilla's [Fira Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Mono), but with fancy ligatures.
* **Theme**: [Tomorrow and Tomorrow Night](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.Theme-TomorrowKit). Why? Because I've always used it and I'm very lazy.
* **Plugins**: I don't install a lot of plugins, but here are some of the ones that I like: [Auto Import](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=steoates.autoimport), [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode).
